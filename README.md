      1. Atleast One layer with Depthwise Separable Convolution
      2. Atleast One layer withDilated Convolution
      3. Three Max pooling layers 
#### *. Number of paramaters should be leass than 1M
#### *. Must use GAP layer
#### *. Total Receptive field should be greater than 44


#### Result:
